The Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM) with a wind sensor is an advanced instrument for measuring precipitation. It uses laser scattering to detect precipitation particles and incorporates a wind sensor to measure wind speed and direction, enhancing precipitation measurement accuracy. This device offers high-resolution data on precipitation, including particle size, shape, and velocity, aiding in understanding precipitation processes and environmental impacts. It finds diverse applications in research, enabling the study of precipitation particle properties, spatial and temporal precipitation variability, and its utility in weather forecasting, flood monitoring, and climate research.
